<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Welcome to Image segmentation for self-driving car project.
After some time that I learned courses about DL and ML, I was so exeited and interested in doing a personal project and research about spesific topic from end to end.

So I did this, in this project I will explore about image segmentation for self-driving car.
In Image segmentation for self-driving car jupyter notebook file I went about the complete process of the project along with code snippets.

### Built With

The main libraries that I used in this project are:

* [![TensorFlow][TensorFlow.js]][TensorFlow-url]
* [![Matplotlib][Matplotlib.js]][Matplotlib-url]
* [![Numpy][Numpy.js]][Numpy-url]

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

In order to see the Image segmentation for self-driving car jupyter notebook file properly, you must have to get a local copy up and running my project in your computer.
This is because in the github site the Image segmentation for self-driving car jupyter notebook file not identifies the images.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

Firstly you need to have app like Visual Studio Code, Pycharm or another app that support jupyter notebooks.

After this you need to ensure that you have all the libraries that I described in section 4 in the Image segmentation for self-driving car jupyter notebook file.
If you have not some library so you can install her in the terminal.
For example if you want to install TensorFlow library you can write in the terminal:

```
pip install tensorflow
```

### Installation

This is how you can install my project to your computer:

1. Go to your terminal

2. Go to the path that you want to downlod to project into and write in the terminal:
   ```
   cd path_that_you_want
   ```

3. Clone the repo, i.e, write in the terminal:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/LiorMichaeli/Image segmentation for self-driving car
   ```

### Download data

If you want to run and train the models yourself you need to download the data.
If you want to see the notebook and what I did this is not nessacry part,
because I went about the complete process of the project along with code snippets and with results.

In order to download the data for the project you need to go and create user.
After you create user you need to go to Download, and download these files:
* gtFine_trainvaltest.zip
* leftImg8bit_trainvaltest.zip

Now create a folder with name 'data' and put these two folders into him(of course after extracting),
and put the data folder in the main project folder(for example where Images folder).


And now get into the Image segmentation for self-driving car jupyter notebook file.
