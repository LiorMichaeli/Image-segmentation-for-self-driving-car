<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Welcome to the Image Segmentation for self-driving cars project.
After some time that I learned courses about DL and ML, I was very excited and interested in doing a personal project and research about specific topic from end to end.

So, I did this, in this project I will explore image segmentation for self-driving cars.
In the Image segmentation for self-driving car Jupyter Notebook file, I went about the complete process of the project along with code snippets.

### Built With

The main libraries that I used in this project are:

* [![TensorFlow][TensorFlow.js]][TensorFlow-url]
* [![Matplotlib][Matplotlib.js]][Matplotlib-url]
* [![Numpy][Numpy.js]][Numpy-url]

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To see the Image segmentation for self-driving car Jupyter Notebook file properly, you must have to get a local copy up and running my project on your computer.
This is because, on the GitHub site, the Image segmentation for self-driving car Jupyter Notebook file does not identify the images.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

Firstly, you need to have an app like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or another app that supports Jupyter Notebooks.

After this, you need to ensure that you have all the libraries that I described in section 4 in the Image segmentation for self-driving car Jupyter Notebook file.
If you do have not a library you can install her in the terminal.
For example, if you want to install the TensorFlow library you can write in the terminal:

```
pip install tensorflow
```

### Installation

This is how you can install my project on your computer:

1. Go to your terminal

2. Go to the path that you want to download to project into and write in the terminal:
   ```
   cd path_that_you_want
   ```

3. Clone the repo, i.e., write in the terminal:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/LiorMichaeli/Image-segmentation-for-self-driving-car
   ```

### Download data

If you want to run and train the models yourself you need to download the data.
If you want to see the notebook and what I did this is not a necessary part,
because I went about the complete process of the project along with code snippets and with results.

To download the data for the project you need to go and create a user.
After you create a user you need to go to Download, and download these files:
* gtFine_trainvaltest.zip
* leftImg8bit_trainvaltest.zip

Now create a folder with the name 'data' and put these two folders into him(of course after extracting),
and put the data folder in the main project folder(for example where Images folder).


Now get into the Image segmentation for the self-driving car Jupyter Notebook file.
